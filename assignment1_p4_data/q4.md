## A.

The image below shows the temperature of one year. User can easily look at specific year using the `time` filter on the right side.

## B.

I used the `DATEDIFF('day', DATETRUNC('year', [Time]), [Time])` to calculate the average historical temperatures. When it's **134th** day in the year, it will pass 60 degrees! It's **may 14th**.

## C.

This chart shows the average temperatures along with min and max temperatures in the same chart in a year. This indicates the temperature ranges in each day.
